# Kaggle Challenge: Image Classification with Machine Learning Kernel Methods

## Introduction

Welcome to our Kaggle challenge for image classification with 10 labels using machine learning kernel methods! This challenge is part of our coursework for Machine Learning with kernel methods (by Michael Arbel, Julien Mairal, Jean-Philippe Vert and Alessandro Rudi) of the Master MVA. Our goal is to develop and apply machine learning models based on kernel methods to accurately classify images into one of ten predefined labels.

## How to run 

You can test several experiments by using the train.py script and choosing the wanted argument. You can run the algorithm which provides us with our best submission file on the leaderboard with the following command:
'''
python start.py
